<h2 class="scroll-element" id="about-me" style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About me</h2>
I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html) in the division of [Medical Image Computing (MIC)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/medical-image-computing/) under the supervision of [Klaus H. Maier-Hein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oCrBpVMAAAAJ&hl=de), where I am fortunate to work with great colleagues like [Fabian Isensee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PjerEe4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Paul JÃ¤ger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9B9-8h0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Prior, I received my M.Sc. at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/) in electrical engineering and information theory in 2019, in which I focused on navigation and control theory, before getting involved in perception with deep neural networks. 

My research focuses on machine learning and its applications in medical image analysis, with a particular interest in understanding the representations learned by deep neural networks and guiding their development. This led me to explore self-supervised learning for 3D medical imaging, where I aim to develop general-purpose representations applicable to various downstream tasks. Notably, I recently collaborated with the German start-up FLOY to develop a large pre-trained brain MRI model. I am also currently leading the development of pre-training methods for [The Human Radiome Project](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/newsroom/article/helmholtz-invests-23-million-in-research-on-ai-foundation-models/), a pilot project of the Helmholtz Foundation Model Initiative, which seeks to create a vision foundation model for 3D radiology. Furthermore, I am currently working on curating a large-scale dataset, establishing a benchmark, and maintaining a comprehensive repository of the most relevant 3D SSL methods to accelerate the 3D medical SSL community.
