<h2 class="scroll-element" id="about-me" style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About me</h2>
I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html) in the division of [Medical Image Computing (MIC)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/medical-image-computing/) under the supervision of [Klaus H. Maier-Hein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oCrBpVMAAAAJ&hl=de), where I am fortunate to work with great colleagues like [Fabian Isensee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PjerEe4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Paul JÃ¤ger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9B9-8h0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Prior, I received my M.Sc. at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/) in electrical engineering and information theory in 2019, in which I focused on navigation and control theory, before getting involved in perception with deep neural networks. 

My research interests focus on understanding learned representations and ML applications to 3D medical image analysis. Specifically I am interested in understanding what different deep learning networks have in common and where they differ. More recently, I am pivoting my focus to 3D medical image analysis, working on developing and benchmarking self-supervised learning and interactive segmentation methods. Through this I hope to unlock the potential of large-scale 3D pre-training, on which I am leading the method development team of [The Human Radiome Project (THRP)](https://www.helmholtz.de/forschung/aktuelle-ausschreibungen/ausschreibung/helmholtz-foundation-model-initiative/).
