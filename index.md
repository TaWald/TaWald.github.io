<h2 class="scroll-element" id="about-me" style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About me</h2>
I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html) in the division of [Medical Image Computing (MIC)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/medical-image-computing/) under the supervision of [Klaus H. Maier-Hein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oCrBpVMAAAAJ&hl=de), where I am fortunate to work with great colleagues like [Fabian Isensee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PjerEe4AAAAJ&hl=en). Prior, I received my M.Sc. at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/) in electrical engineering and information theory in 2019, in which I focused on navigation and control theory, before getting involved in perception with deep neural networks. 

My research interests focus on understanding machine learning and applying it to medical image analysis -- specifically I am interested in understanding what different deep learning networks have in common and where they differ in order to improve robustness of an ensemble and decrease silent failures. More recently, due to the advance of [SAM](https://segment-anything.com) and [SEEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06718), I am interested in unlocking the potential that 3D vision foundation models hold for radiology.
